        Hi! My name is Nicholas Dang!
    </p>
    <p>
        I am a third-year student at the University of Kansas studying computer science! I enjoy many of my hobbies including golfing, music, and cooking.
        I love to sing and record song covers, as well as do karaoke. I can also play some instruments including guitar and viola. When I used to be not
        so busy, I played viola in the University of Kansas Symphony Orchestra. My favorite artist at the moment has been The Weeknd, and I am going to 
        link a few of my favorite songs. That's all I have to say. I don't think I'm all that interesting to warrant a longer biography. Bye!
